# The "Zero to Hero" DIY Web & App Development Curriculum

This is a complete, self-paced curriculum designed for learning at home. It assumes zero prior knowledge and focuses on modern, industry-standard tools that are free to use.

## 🛠️ Phase 0: The Setup (Hardware & Software)
Before writing a single line of code, you need your digital workbench ready.

### Hardware
*   **Computer**: Any Laptop or Desktop (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
    *   *Minimum*: 8GB RAM, i5 Processor (or equivalent).
    *   *Recommended*: 16GB RAM, SSD Storage.
*   **Monitor**: A second monitor is highly recommended (one for code, one for tutorial/preview).

### Software (The "Stack") - All Free
1.  **Code Editor**: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Visual Studio Code). The industry standard.
    *   *Extensions to Install*: Live Server, Prettier, ESLint, Auto Rename Tag.
2.  **Browser**: [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
    *   *Why*: It has the best "Developer Tools" (Right-click -> Inspect) for debugging.
3.  **Terminal**:
    *   *Mac*: Use the built-in "Terminal" or "iTerm2".
    *   *Windows*: Install "Git Bash" (comes with Git).
4.  **Version Control**: [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
    *   *Purpose*: Saves versions of your code and lets you collaborate.
5.  **Runtime**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS Version).
    *   *Purpose*: Runs JavaScript outside the browser (needed for modern tools).

## 📅 Phase 1: The Foundations (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal**: Build static websites that look good on mobile and desktop.

### 1. HTML5 (The Skeleton)
*   **Learn**: Tags, Attributes, Semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`), Forms, SEO basics.
*   **Project**: Build a "Personal Resume" page. Text, profile picture, contact link.

### 2. CSS3 (The Style)
*   **Learn**: Selectors (Class/ID), Colors, Fonts, Box Model (Padding/Margin/Border).
*   **Crucial**: Flexbox & Grid (This is how you layout pages).
*   **Responsive Design**: Media Queries (making it look good on phones).
*   **Project**: Style your Resume. Make it look like a professional document.

### 3. Git & GitHub (The Safety Net)
*   **Learn**: `git init`, `git add .`, `git commit`, `git push`.
*   **Action**: Create a GitHub account and upload your Resume project.

## ⚡ Phase 2: Interactivity & JavaScript (Weeks 5-10)
**Goal**: Make websites "do" things. This is the hardest part—don't give up!

### 1. JavaScript Basics (The Logic)
*   **Learn**: Variables, Data Types, Functions, Loops, If/Else Logic.
*   **DOM Manipulation**: Changing HTML content via JS (e.g., clicking a button hides an image).

### 2. Intermediate JS
*   **Learn**: Events (Clicks, Keypresses), Arrays, Objects, `fetch()` (getting data from an API).
*   **Project**: **To-Do List App**. Add tasks, delete tasks, save to "Local Storage" so they stay after refresh.

## 🚀 Phase 3: Modern Frontend Frameworks (Weeks 11-16)
**Goal**: Build complex, fast "Web Apps" like Instagram or Airbnb.

### 1. React.js (The Industry King)
*   **Learn**: Components, Props, State (useState), Effects (useEffect).
*   **Tool**: use `Vite` to create projects (faster than Create React App).
*   **Styling**: Learn **Tailwind CSS** (Utility-first CSS) now. It speeds up styling 10x.

### 2. Project: Movie Search App
*   **Action**: Use a free API (like OMDB) to search for movies and display posters/ratings.
*   **Deploy**: Host it for free on **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

## 💾 Phase 4: Backend & Database (Weeks 17-24)
**Goal**: Handle users, logins, and real data.

### 1. Node.js & Express (The Server)
*   **Learn**: Building a simple API, Routing, Middleware.

### 2. Databases
*   **SQL**: PostgreSQL (Structured, strict).
*   **NoSQL**: MongoDB or Firebase (Flexible, easier to start).
*   **Recommendation**: Start with **Firebase** (Google's platform). It handles Auth (Login) and Database easily for beginners.

### 3. Project: Full Stack E-Commerce Store
*   **Features**: Product listing, Cart, Fake Checkout, User Login.

---

## 📱 Phase 5: Mobile Apps (Optional Specialization)
**Goal**: Take your React knowledge to mobile.

*   **React Native**: Uses 90% of the React code you already learned but outputs an iOS and Android app.
*   **Expo**: The tool to easily run React Native apps on your real phone while coding.

## 🏆 Your Strategy
1.  **Code Every Day**: Even if it's just 20 minutes. Consistency beats intensity.
2.  **Don't memorize**: You will always Google things. Experienced developers Google basic things daily.
3.  **Build over Watch**: Tutorial Hell is real. Watch a video, then *close it* and try to build something similar on your own.
