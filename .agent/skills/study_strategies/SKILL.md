# Study Strategies Skill

## The Problem with Passive Studying

❌ **Ineffective:**
- Re-reading notes
- Highlighting everything
- Watching without doing

✅ **Effective:**
- Active recall
- Spaced repetition
- Teaching others

## Active Recall

Test yourself instead of re-reading:
1. Close the book
2. Try to remember
3. Check what you missed
4. Focus on gaps

**Flashcards are active recall.**

## Spaced Repetition

Review at optimal intervals:

```
Day 1: Learn material
Day 2: First review (easy)
Day 4: Second review
Day 7: Third review
Day 14: Fourth review
Month 1: Fifth review
```

**Anki:** App that automates this.

## The Feynman Technique

1. **Study** the concept
2. **Explain** it like teaching a child
3. **Identify** gaps in your explanation
4. **Review** source material
5. **Simplify** further

If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it.

## Interleaving

Don't study one topic for hours. Mix:
- 20 min Topic A
- 20 min Topic B
- 20 min Topic C
- Repeat

Harder initially, better long-term.

## Pomodoro Technique

```
25 min: Focused work
5 min: Break
[Repeat 4x]
15-30 min: Longer break
```

## Environment Design

- Dedicated study space
- Phone in another room
- Website blockers
- Consistent time blocks

## When to Apply
Use when studying for exams, learning new skills, or retaining information.
