# Trucking Factoring Skill

## What is Factoring?

Sell your invoices to get paid immediately instead of waiting 30-90 days.

```
You deliver load → Invoice broker ($1,000)
                ↓
Factor pays you: $970 (97%)
                ↓
Broker pays factor: $1,000 (30-60 days later)
                ↓
Factor keeps: $30 (3% fee)
```

## Factoring Companies

| Company | Rate | Recourse? |
|---------|------|-----------|
| RTS Financial | 2-5% | Yes |
| Triumph | 1.5-3% | Both |
| OTR Solutions | 2-4% | Yes |
| TBS Factoring | 2.5-4% | Yes |
| Apex Capital | 2-4% | Yes |

### Recourse vs Non-Recourse

| Recourse | Non-Recourse |
|----------|--------------|
| Lower rate | Higher rate |
| YOU pay if broker doesn't | THEY eat the loss |
| More common | Harder to get |

## When to Factor

✅ **Factor when:**
- Cash flow is tight
- Need fuel money now
- Starting out (no credit)
- Large fleet, many invoices

❌ **Avoid factoring when:**
- Broker pays quickly (< 15 days)
- You have cash reserves
- Small margins (factoring eats profit)

## Direct Invoicing (Keep 100%)

If you can wait 30 days:
1. Create professional invoice (QuickBooks, free templates)
2. Include: MC#, load details, BOL, rate confirmation
3. Submit per broker's process
4. Follow up at 15 and 30 days

## Cash Flow Calculator

```
Load pay: $3,000
Fuel: $600
Factor fee (3%): $90

Immediate cash: $2,310

Without factoring (wait 30 days):
Keep: $2,400 (saved $90)
```

## When to Apply
Use when deciding on factoring, managing cash flow, or invoicing brokers.
