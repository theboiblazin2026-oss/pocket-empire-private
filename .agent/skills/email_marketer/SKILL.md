# Email Marketer Skill

## Cold Email Framework

### AIDA Structure
1. **Attention**: Hook in subject/first line
2. **Interest**: Relevant problem/opportunity
3. **Desire**: Solution/benefit
4. **Action**: Clear CTA

### Example Cold Email
```
Subject: Quick question about [specific thing]

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [specific observation about their business].

We helped [similar company] [achieve specific result] in [timeframe].

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if we could help [Company Name] do the same?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. [Personalized detail or social proof]
```

## Follow-Up Sequence

| Email | Timing | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Day 0 | Initial outreach |
| 2 | Day 3 | "Did you see my email?" |
| 3 | Day 7 | Add new value/insight |
| 4 | Day 14 | Different angle |
| 5 | Day 21 | Break-up email |

### Break-Up Email
```
Subject: Closing your file

Hi [Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'll assume the timing isn't right.

I'll close your file for now, but feel free to reach out if things change.

Best,
[Name]
```

## Subject Line Formulas
