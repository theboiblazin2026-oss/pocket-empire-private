# Negotiation Expert Skill

## BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement)

**Know your walkaway point before negotiating.**

> "What will I do if this deal falls through?"

A strong BATNA = negotiation leverage.

## Key Tactics

### Anchoring
> Make the first offer when you have information advantage.
> Their counter will be influenced by your anchor.

### Bracketing
> If they offer $50k and you want $70k, ask for $90k.
> The compromise lands near your target.

### Silence
> After making an offer, stop talking.
> Uncomfortable silence pressures concessions.

### Flinch
> React negatively to their first offer.
> "Wow, that's higher than I expected..."

## The Ackerman Model

1. Set target price
2. First offer: 65% of target
3. Three raises: 85%, 95%, 100%
4. Use precise numbers (not round)
5. Final number includes non-monetary item

## Questions to Ask

- "How did you arrive at that number?"
- "What would make this work for you?"
- "Is there any flexibility on [X]?"
- "What if we adjusted [Y]?"

## Win-Win Framework

| Your Need | Their Need | Solution |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Lower price | Quick close | Pay cash, close faster |
| More time | Certainty | Longer term, guaranteed |
| Features | Budget | Phased delivery |

## Common Mistakes

- Accepting first offer
- Negotiating against yourself
- Revealing your deadline
- Focusing only on price

## When to Apply
Use when negotiating deals, salaries, contracts, or any business transaction.
