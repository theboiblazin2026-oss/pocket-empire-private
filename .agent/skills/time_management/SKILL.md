# Time Management Skill

## Time Blocking

Schedule specific blocks for specific work:

```
6:00 - 7:00   Morning routine
7:00 - 9:00   Deep work (most important task)
9:00 - 10:00  Email/admin
10:00 - 12:00 Meetings
12:00 - 1:00  Lunch
1:00 - 3:00   Project work
3:00 - 4:00   Communication
4:00 - 5:00   Planning tomorrow
```

## Eisenhower Matrix

|  | Urgent | Not Urgent |
|--|--------|------------|
| **Important** | DO NOW: Crises, deadlines | SCHEDULE: Goals, planning |
| **Not Important** | DELEGATE: Interruptions | ELIMINATE: Time wasters |

## Pomodoro Technique

```
🍅 25 min: Work (no interruptions)
☕ 5 min: Break
[Repeat 4x]
🛋️ 15-30 min: Long break
```

**Track pomodoros** to measure productivity.

## Eat the Frog

Do your hardest/most important task **first**.
- Highest willpower in morning
- Rest of day feels easier
- No dread hanging over you

## Parkinson's Law

> Work expands to fill the time available.

**Solution:** Set artificial deadlines.
- "I'll finish this in 2 hours" not "I have all day"

## Energy Management

| Time | Energy | Best For |
|------|--------|----------|
| Morning | High | Creative, strategic |
| Midday | Medium | Meetings, collaboration |
| Afternoon | Low | Admin, routine |
| Evening | Varies | Review, planning |

## Batching

Group similar tasks:
- All calls in one block
- All emails twice daily
- All errands in one trip

**Context switching kills productivity.**

## When to Apply
Use when planning days, optimizing schedules, or improving productivity.
