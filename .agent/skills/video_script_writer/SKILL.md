# Video Script Writer Skill

## Video Structure

### Hook (0-5 seconds)
> Grab attention immediately.

Examples:
- "The biggest mistake everyone makes with X..."
- "This one trick changed everything for me."
- "Don't do this until you watch this video."

### Setup (5-30 seconds)
> Establish the problem and promise value.

"If you've ever struggled with X, you're not alone. Today I'll show you exactly how to solve it in 3 simple steps."

### Content (Main body)
> Deliver on the promise. Keep it structured.

- Use numbered steps or sections
- Pattern interrupts every 30-60 seconds
- B-roll, graphics, cuts to maintain attention

### CTA (End)
> Tell them what to do next.

"If this helped, smash that like button and subscribe for more. Drop a comment telling me which tip you'll try first."

## Pacing Tips

| Length | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| < 60s | TikTok, Reels, Shorts |
| 3-5 min | Tutorials, explainers |
| 8-12 min | Deep dives (YT algorithm sweet spot) |
| 20+ min | Podcasts, long-form |

## Retention Techniques

- **Open loops**: "I'll explain why this works in a minute..."
- **Pattern interrupts**: Cut, zoom, sound effect
- **Direct address**: "You might be thinking..."
- **Numbered lists**: "Tip number 3 is the most important..."
