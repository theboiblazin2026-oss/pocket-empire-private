# Debt Elimination Skill

## The Debt Payoff Methods

### Avalanche Method (Mathematically Optimal)
Pay minimums on all, extra goes to **highest interest rate** first.

```
Credit Card 1: 24.99% APR ← Attack first
Credit Card 2: 19.99% APR
Personal Loan: 12% APR
Car Loan: 6% APR
```

**Saves the most money overall.**

### Snowball Method (Psychologically Optimal)
Pay minimums on all, extra goes to **smallest balance** first.

```
Credit Card 2: $500 balance ← Attack first
Credit Card 1: $2,000 balance
Personal Loan: $5,000 balance
Car Loan: $15,000 balance
```

**Quick wins build momentum.**

## Credit Repair Integration

### Dispute Order
1. Late payments (most impact on score)
2. Collections (especially medical)
3. Charge-offs
4. High utilization accounts

### Pay-for-Delete Strategy
1. Contact creditor/collector
2. Offer lump sum (start at 40%)
3. Request deletion in exchange
4. Get agreement in writing FIRST
5. Pay only after written confirmation

## Debt-to-Income Ratio

```
Total Monthly Debt Payments / Gross Monthly Income = DTI

Example: $1,500 / $5,000 = 30% DTI
```

| DTI | Status |
|-----|--------|
| < 20% | Excellent |
| 20-35% | Healthy |
| 36-49% | Concerning |
| 50%+ | Crisis |

## Negotiation Scripts

### Settlement Call
> "I'm experiencing financial hardship and want to resolve this account. I can offer a one-time payment of $X if you can remove this from my credit report. Can you help me with that?"

### Hardship Program
> "I'm having difficulty making payments due to [reason]. Do you have any hardship programs that could lower my interest rate or payment temporarily?"

## Emergency Fund First?

**Controversial but smart:**
- Save $1,000 emergency fund FIRST
- Then attack debt
- Prevents going back into debt for emergencies

## When to Apply
Use when creating debt payoff plans, negotiating with creditors, or improving credit.
