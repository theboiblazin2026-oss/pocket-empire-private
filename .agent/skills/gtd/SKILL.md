# GTD (Getting Things Done) Skill

## The Core Problem GTD Solves

Your brain is for **having ideas**, not **holding ideas**. When you try to remember everything, you:
- Feel overwhelmed
- Forget important things
- Can't focus on what's in front of you

GTD creates a **trusted external system** so your mind can relax.

## The 5 Steps

### 1. CAPTURE
Get everything out of your head into an inbox:
- Physical inbox for papers
- Digital inbox (notes app, email)
- Voice memos

**Rule:** Capture EVERYTHING. Don't judge, just capture.

### 2. CLARIFY
Process each item:

```
Is it actionable?
├── NO → Trash, Reference, or Someday/Maybe
└── YES → What's the next action?
    ├── < 2 minutes? → Do it now
    ├── Delegate? → Waiting For list
    └── Defer? → Next Actions or Calendar
```

### 3. ORGANIZE
Put clarified items in the right place:

| List | Contains |
|------|----------|
| Next Actions | Single, physical actions by context |
| Projects | Anything needing 2+ actions |
| Waiting For | Delegated items |
| Someday/Maybe | Ideas for later |
| Calendar | Time-specific commitments |
| Reference | Information to keep |

### 4. REFLECT
Weekly Review (most important habit):
- [ ] Clear all inboxes
- [ ] Review Next Actions
- [ ] Review Projects (stuck? what's next?)
- [ ] Review Waiting For
- [ ] Review Calendar (past & upcoming)
- [ ] Review Someday/Maybe
- [ ] Brain dump new items

### 5. ENGAGE
Choose what to do based on:
1. **Context** - Where are you? (@home, @computer, @errands)
2. **Time** - How much do you have?
3. **Energy** - High, medium, or low?
4. **Priority** - What matters most?

## Context Examples

| Context | Actions |
|---------|---------|
| @Computer | Write report, send emails |
| @Phone | Call doctor, follow up with client |
| @Errands | Buy groceries, pick up dry cleaning |
| @Home | Fix leaky faucet, organize closet |
| @Waiting | Review while waiting for someone |

## The 2-Minute Rule

If an action takes less than 2 minutes, **do it immediately**.
Processing time > action time = inefficient.

## Projects vs Next Actions

**Wrong:** "Plan vacation" (too vague)
**Right:** 
- Project: "Plan Hawaii vacation"
- Next Action: "Research flights to Honolulu on Google Flights"

## When to Apply
Use when feeling overwhelmed, processing inboxes, or during weekly reviews.
