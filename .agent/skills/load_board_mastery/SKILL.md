Position yourself for hot lanes.
```

## Broker Vetting

Before accepting:
1. **Credit check** - Truckstop/DAT
2. **Days to pay** - Under 30 preferred
3. **Reviews** - Check Google, forums
4. **MC age** - Avoid brand new MCs
5. **Rate confirmation** - Get it signed before pickup

## Negotiation Tips

> "I see the rate is $1,200. My truck doesn't move for under $1,500 on this lane. Can you come up?"

- Know market rate (DAT hot market)
- Be willing to walk away
- Call don't just email/book
- Build relationships for repeat loads

## Direct Shippers (Best Margin)

Skip brokers entirely:
1. Research manufacturers in your area
2. Call logistics/shipping department
3. Offer reliable service at broker rates
4. They save 15-20%, you make more

## When to Apply
Use when booking loads, vetting brokers, or negotiating rates.
