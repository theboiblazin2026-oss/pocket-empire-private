# Speed Reading Skill

## Why You Read Slowly

1. **Subvocalization** - "Saying" words in your head
2. **Regression** - Re-reading sentences
3. **Small fixations** - Reading word by word
4. **Distractions** - Mind wandering

## Core Techniques

### 1. Use a Pointer
Guide your eyes with finger or pen:
- Forces faster movement
- Reduces regression
- Keeps focus

### 2. Chunking
Read groups of words, not individual words:

**Slow:** The | quick | brown | fox | jumped
**Fast:** The quick brown | fox jumped over

### 3. Expand Peripheral Vision
Practice seeing more words per fixation:
- Start at 3 words
- Expand to 5-7
- Train with narrow columns

### 4. Reduce Subvocalization
- Speed beyond your "speaking" pace
- Listen to music (occupies verbal brain)
- Focus on meaning, not sound
