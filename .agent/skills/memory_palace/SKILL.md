# Memory Palace Skill

## The Method of Loci (Memory Palace)

### How It Works
1. Visualize a familiar place (your home)
2. Place items to remember at specific locations
3. "Walk through" the place to recall

### Example: Grocery List
```
Location: Your Home

Front door → Giant MILK carton blocking entrance
Living room → EGGS hatching on the couch
Kitchen → BREAD loaves stacked like bricks
Bathroom → BUTTER covering the mirror
Bedroom → APPLES raining from ceiling
```

### Why It Works
- Spatial memory is powerful
- Vivid images stick
- Familiar routes are automatic

## Memory Enhancement Techniques

### 1. Visualization
Make it:
- **Vivid** - Bright colors, exaggerated size
- **Unusual** - Weird = memorable
- **Active** - Moving, not static
- **Emotional** - Funny, scary, romantic

### 2. Association
Link new info to known info:
- Name + Face: "Tall Tim with the tie"
- Number + Shape: 2 = swan, 8 = snowman

### 3. Chunking
Break into smaller pieces:
- Phone: 555-867-5309 → 555 | 867 | 5309
- Cards: Group by suit

### 4. Spaced Repetition
Review at increasing intervals:
- Day 1: Learn
