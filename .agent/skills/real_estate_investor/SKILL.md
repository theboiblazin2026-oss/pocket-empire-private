## Key Metrics

### Cash-on-Cash Return
```
Annual Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested = CoC Return

Example:
$12,000 / $50,000 = 24% CoC Return
```

### Cap Rate
```
Net Operating Income / Purchase Price = Cap Rate

Example:
$24,000 / $300,000 = 8% Cap Rate
```

### The 1% Rule
> Monthly rent should be ≥ 1% of purchase price

$200,000 property → $2,000+/month rent
