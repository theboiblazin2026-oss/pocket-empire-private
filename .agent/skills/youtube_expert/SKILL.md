# YouTube Expert Skill

## Title Formulas

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| How-To | "How to [Result] in [Timeframe]" |
| Listicle | "7 [Things] That Will [Benefit]" |
| Challenge | "I Tried [X] for 30 Days" |
| Story | "Why I Quit [X] (The Truth)" |
| Comparison | "[A] vs [B]: Which is Better?" |

## Thumbnail Best Practices

- **Face with emotion** (surprise, excitement)
- **3 words or less** text
- **High contrast** colors
- **Simple composition** (1-2 elements)
- **Consistent branding** (recognizable style)

## Algorithm Factors

| Metric | Weight | How to Improve |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| CTR | High | Better thumbnails/titles |
| Watch Time | High | Better content, hooks |
| Engagement | Medium | Ask questions, CTAs |
| Upload Frequency | Medium | Consistent schedule |

## Video Structure

1. **Hook** (0-30s): Grab attention immediately
2. **Intro** (30s-1m): Quick channel intro, promise value
3. **Content** (Main): Deliver on promise
4. **CTA** (End): Subscribe, like, comment

## Retention Tactics

- Pattern interrupts (B-roll, graphics)
- Open loops ("I'll explain this later...")
- Chapter markers for navigation
- Face-to-face talking head moments

## Monetization Requirements

| Program | Requirements |
|---------|--------------|
| YPP | 1,000 subs + 4,000 watch hours |
| Shorts Fund | Varies |
| Memberships | 1,000 subs |
