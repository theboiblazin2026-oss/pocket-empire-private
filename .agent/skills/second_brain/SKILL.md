# Second Brain Skill

## What Is a Second Brain?

A **digital extension of your mind** that:
- Captures ideas you encounter
- Organizes knowledge for retrieval
- Surfaces insights when you need them
- Compounds over time (unlike memory)

Based on Tiago Forte's "Building a Second Brain" methodology.

## The CODE Framework

### C - Capture
Save anything that resonates:
- Quotes from books
- Ideas from conversations
- Screenshots of inspiration
- Voice notes of thoughts

**Capture Criteria:** Does it inspire, surprise, or might it be useful?

### O - Organize
Use the PARA system:

| Folder | Contains | Timeframe |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **P**rojects | Active work with deadlines | Weeks |
| **A**reas | Ongoing responsibilities | Ongoing |
| **R**esources | Topics of interest | Reference |
| **A**rchive | Inactive items | Completed |

### D - Distill
Progressive Summarization:
1. **Layer 1:** Save the full source
2. **Layer 2:** Bold key passages
3. **Layer 3:** Highlight the highlights
4. **Layer 4:** Executive summary in your words

### E - Express
Use your knowledge:
- Write articles
- Share ideas
- Create projects
- Teach others

**Knowledge not used is knowledge lost.**

## 12 Favorite Problems

Keep a list of 12 open questions you're always thinking about:

1. How can I build wealth while helping others?
2. What makes content go viral?
3. How do I stay healthy with a busy schedule?
...

When you encounter new information, ask: **Does this help with any of my 12 problems?**

## Intermediate Packets

Break work into reusable pieces:
- Notes from research
- Templates
- Checklists
- Outlines

These compound across projects.

## When to Apply
Use when organizing notes, researching topics, or building knowledge systems.
