# Sales Expert Skill

## Objection Handling

### Framework: Feel, Felt, Found
> "I understand how you feel. Others have felt the same way. What they found was..."

### Common Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Too expensive" | "Compared to what? Let's look at the ROI..." |
| "Need to think about it" | "What specifically would you like to think through?" |
| "Not the right time" | "What would make it the right time?" |
| "Need to talk to [someone]" | "Great, let's schedule a call with them included." |
| "Already have a solution" | "I'm curious, how is that working for you?" |

## Closing Techniques

### Assumptive Close
> "So we'll start with the Pro plan. Should I send the invoice to this email?"

### Alternative Close
> "Would you prefer to start this week or next Monday?"

### Summary Close
> "So you said you need [X], [Y], and [Z]. Our solution addresses all three. Ready to move forward?"

### Urgency Close
> "The current pricing ends Friday. Want to lock it in?"

## Discovery Questions

### SPIN Selling
- **Situation**: "How are you currently handling X?"
- **Problem**: "What challenges do you face with that?"
- **Implication**: "How does that impact [revenue/time/team]?"
- **Need-Payoff**: "If we solved that, what would it mean for your business?"
