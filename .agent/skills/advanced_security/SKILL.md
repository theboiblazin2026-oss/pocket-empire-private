# Advanced Security Special Ops

## Capabilities
- **Pentesting**: Methodology for reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, and reporting (Ethical Hacking).
- **Reverse Engineering**: Analyzing binary execution, decompilation, and understanding malware behavior safely.
- **Cryptography**: Implementing secure communication, understanding standard algorithms (AES, RSA, ECC), and avoiding "rolling your own crypto".

## Tools & Frameworks
- **Kali Linux**: The standard toolkit (Metasploit, Nmap, Wireshark).
- **Ghidra/IDA Pro**: For disassembling and reverse engineering.
- **Burp Suite**: For web application security testing.

## Procedures
1. **Reconnaissance**: Passive and active information gathering.
2. **Scanning**: Identifying vulnerabilities.
3. **Exploitation**: Proof of concept (Safe environments only).
4. **Reporting**: Documenting findings and remediation steps.
