# Public Speaking Skill

## Speech Structure

### The Rule of Three
- 3 main points
- 3 supporting examples
- 3 is memorable

### Classic Structure
1. **Hook** (30 sec) - Grab attention
2. **Setup** (1 min) - Why this matters
3. **Body** (bulk) - Main points
4. **Conclusion** (1 min) - Summary + CTA

## Opening Hooks

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Question | "How many of you have ever...?" |
| Statistic | "Every 60 seconds..." |
| Story | "Last Tuesday, I was..." |
| Quote | "Einstein once said..." |
| Bold claim | "Everything you know about X is wrong." |

**Never start with:** "Today I'm going to talk about..."

## Delivery Tips

### Voice
- **Vary pace** - Fast for excitement, slow for emphasis
- **Pause** - Before key points (power move)
- **Project** - Speak to the back row
- **Avoid filler** - Um, uh, like, you know

### Body Language
- Eye contact (3-5 seconds per person)
- Open posture (no crossed arms)
- Move with purpose
- Gestures match words

### Nerves
- Adrenaline is energy, not fear
- First 30 seconds are hardest
- Practice opening until automatic
- Audience wants you to succeed

## Preparation Formula

```
1 hour of speaking = 10 hours of prep
1 minute of speaking = 1 hour of prep (major speech)
```

## Slide Rules

- 1 idea per slide
- Max 6 words per bullet
- Images > Text
- You are the presentation, slides are support

## When to Apply
Use when preparing presentations, pitches, or any public speaking situation.
