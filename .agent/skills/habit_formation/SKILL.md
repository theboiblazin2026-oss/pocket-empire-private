# Habit Formation Skill

## The Habit Loop

```
CUE → ROUTINE → REWARD
```

- **Cue:** Trigger that starts behavior
- **Routine:** The behavior itself
- **Reward:** Benefit you get

## Atomic Habits Framework (James Clear)

### Make Good Habits
1. **Obvious** - Cue visible
2. **Attractive** - Tempting
3. **Easy** - Low friction
4. **Satisfying** - Immediate reward

### Break Bad Habits
1. **Invisible** - Hide cues
2. **Unattractive** - Reframe
3. **Difficult** - Add friction
4. **Unsatisfying** - Add consequence

## Implementation Intentions

**Formula:** "I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]."

❌ "I'll exercise more"
✅ "I will run at 7am in the park"

## Habit Stacking

**Formula:** "After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]."

- After I pour my coffee, I will write 3 things I'm grateful for.
- After I sit down at my desk, I will write my top 3 priorities.

## The Two-Minute Rule

Start with 2 minutes:
- Read → Read one page
- Exercise → Put on gym shoes
- Meditate → Sit for 2 minutes

**Establish the habit first, optimize later.**

## Environment Design

- Want to read? Book on pillow
- Want to exercise? Clothes laid out
- Want to eat healthy? Fruit on counter

**Make good choices the default.**

## Habit Tracking

Track streaks:
- Don't break the chain
- Visual progress = motivation
- Aim for consistency, not perfection

"Never miss twice."

## When to Apply
Use when building new habits, breaking bad ones, or designing behavior change.
