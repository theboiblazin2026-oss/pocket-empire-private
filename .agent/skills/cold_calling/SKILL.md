# Cold Calling Skill

## The Cold Call Framework

### 1. Pattern Interrupt (First 5 seconds)
Don't sound like a salesperson:

❌ "Hi, how are you today?"
✅ "Hey [Name], this is [You] from [Company]. Did I catch you at a bad time?"

### 2. Value Statement (Next 10 seconds)
```
"The reason I'm calling is we help [target audience] 
solve [specific problem]. I'm not sure if that's 
something you're dealing with?"
```

### 3. Discovery Questions
- "What's your biggest challenge with X?"
- "How are you currently handling Y?"
- "What happens if this doesn't get solved?"

### 4. Qualification
- Budget (can they afford it?)
- Authority (decision maker?)
- Need (do they have the problem?)
- Timeline (when do they need it?)

### 5. Close or Next Step
- Book a meeting
- Send information
- Schedule callback

## Handling Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Not interested" | "I completely understand. Most people say that before they see how we've helped [similar company]. Can I share one quick example?" |
| "Send info" | "Happy to. What specifically would you want to see? I can point you to the most relevant stuff." |
| "No budget" | "Totally get it. When does your next budget cycle start? I can follow up then." |
| "We have a provider" | "Great! How's that going for you? Most of my clients also had someone before we met." |

## Call Volume Math

```
100 dials → 20 conversations → 5 qualified → 1-2 deals

Conversion rate: 1-2%
Need 100 dials for 1 deal? Make 500 for 5.
```

## Best Times to Call

| Time | Quality |
|------|---------|
| 8-9 AM | High (before meetings) |
| 11 AM - 12 PM | Medium |
| 4-5 PM | High (end of day) |
| Wednesday-Thursday | Best days |

## When to Apply
Use when making sales calls, following up on leads, or cold outreach.
