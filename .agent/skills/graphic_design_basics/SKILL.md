# Graphic Design Basics Skill

## Color Theory

### Color Harmonies

| Harmony | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Complementary | Opposite on wheel (high contrast) |
| Analogous | Adjacent colors (harmonious) |
| Triadic | 3 evenly spaced (vibrant) |
| Split-Complementary | Base + 2 adjacent to complement |

### Psychology

| Color | Emotion |
|-------|---------|
| Blue | Trust, calm, professional |
| Red | Urgency, passion, energy |
| Green | Growth, health, money |
| Yellow | Optimism, attention |
| Black | Luxury, power, elegance |
| White | Clean, minimal, space |

## Typography

### Font Pairing Rules

- 2 fonts maximum (heading + body)
- Contrast in style (serif + sans-serif)
- Same mood (both modern, both classic)

### Hierarchy

1. **Headline**: Large, bold (40-72px)
2. **Subhead**: Medium (24-32px)
3. **Body**: Readable (16-18px)
4. **Caption**: Small (12-14px)

### Readability

- Line height: 1.4-1.6x font size
- Line length: 50-75 characters
- Left-aligned (not justified for web)

## Layout Principles

### Rule of Thirds
Divide canvas into 3x3 grid; place key elements on intersections.

### White Space
Empty space is not wasted - it creates focus and breathing room.

### Alignment
Everything should align to something. Create invisible grid lines.

### Repetition
Repeat colors, fonts, shapes for consistency.

## Tools

| Tool | Best For |
|------|----------|
| Figma | UI/UX, collaboration |
| Canva | Quick graphics, social |
| Photoshop | Photo editing, complex |
| Illustrator | Vectors, logos |
| Midjourney | AI-generated images |

## When to Apply
Use when creating graphics, reviewing designs, or discussing visual principles.
